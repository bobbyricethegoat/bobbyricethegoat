        <h2>The Incheon Landing</h2>
        <p>
          The Incheon Landing, part of Operation Chromite, began on <strong>September 15, 1950, at 06:30 hours</strong>. The weather was overcast, with light winds and fog blanketing the horizon—ideal for strategic surprise but challenging for naval landings. The UN forces, led by General Douglas MacArthur, executed this amphibious assault in hopes of turning the tide of the Korean War by liberating Seoul and cutting North Korean supply lines.

        <h3>Conditions & First Naval Movement</h3>
        <p>
          The weather conditions were cold and unpredictable. As dawn broke, troops could hear the sound of waves crashing as their ships moved toward the landing site. Visibility was limited by fog, but soldiers pushed forward with confidence, knowing that their success depended on landing at Incheon with speed and precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial naval bombardments began at 05:30 hours, softening enemy defenses and clearing obstacles in preparation for the landing. Troops stationed on ships were both eager and apprehensive, knowing that this was a bold gamble that could shift the momentum of the war.

        <h3>The Landing</h3>
        <p>
          The first troops began landing on the beaches at 06:30 hours. Under cover from naval artillery, these soldiers disembarked from landing craft, stormed the shores, and secured key positions. The first squads were tasked with establishing a secure beachhead, neutralizing enemy positions, and creating pathways for additional forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soldiers advanced in disciplined formations, some encountering resistance from North Korean troops who were dug into defensive positions. The chaos of artillery explosions, machine-gun fire, and waves crashing against their landing craft heightened the tension as they stormed forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among these units were reconnaissance squads tasked with locating and disabling enemy supply routes. Their bravery, combined with effective strategy, paved the way for reinforcements and secured vital positions on the beach.

      <!-- Heroic Actions & Sacrifices -->
      <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Heroic Acts</h3>
        <p>
          Despite the danger and uncertainty, soldiers exhibited incredible bravery. Troops worked together to push forward, capturing key supply points and breaking through defensive lines. Many soldiers sacrificed their lives to ensure that their comrades could advance inland. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most heroic moments occurred during the initial push when soldiers scaled rocky shores under constant fire, dismantling North Korean resistance and ensuring that their units could proceed inland to secure objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coordinated efforts of these soldiers, supported by naval bombardments and air power, ensured that the initial landing was successful. The operation had begun with precision and determination.

        <h3>Aftermath</h3>
        <p>
          By 10:00 hours, most troops had successfully landed at Incheon and began advancing inland toward Seoul. The North Korean defenses crumbled under sustained UN pressure, aided by strategic naval bombardments and coordinated ground movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The success of the initial landing was pivotal, as it allowed UN forces to reclaim Seoul, disrupt North Korean supply chains, and change the trajectory of the Korean War. Soldiers celebrated their hard-won victories, though many were haunted by the cost of the battle and the sacrifices they made to achieve this strategic success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operation Chromite had effectively reversed the momentum of the war, creating opportunities for UN forces to push back against North Korean advances and solidify South Korea’s path toward recovery.
