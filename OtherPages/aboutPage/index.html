                    <p>The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when North Korea invaded South Korea. By the summer of 1950, North Korean forces had pushed South Korean and UN forces into a small corner of the peninsula, known as the Busan Perimeter. To counter this, General MacArthur proposed a bold landing at Incheon, far behind enemy lines.</p>
